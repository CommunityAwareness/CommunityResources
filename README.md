*George Floyd was in Minneapolis on business,  when four police officers murdered him in broad daylight*

*He was dragged from his car, pinned to the ground, and choked as he begged for air, after being accused of presenting a counterfit bill*

*Video recordings show officer Derek Chauvin employing a deadly chokehold as Floyd repeatedly states, "I can't breath"*
